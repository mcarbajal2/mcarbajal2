	<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>
	<p>My name is <span class="emp">Mirnary</span> Carbajal. I'm a junior at <span class="emp">Georgia State</span> and I'm majoring in
	<span class="emp">Computer Science</span> and also minoring in Japanese. I was born here in Georgia, and I've pretty much
	always lived here except for a few years I spent in Houston, Texas during elementary.</p>
	
	<p>I chose <span class = "emp">Computer Science</span> because I've always liked playing with computers ever since I was young.
	As for studying Japanese, I really love learning new languages, and Japanese was the one that I chose to study because I wanted a
	<span class="emp">challenge</span>, and I also love the way it sounds. Surprisingly enough, Japanese is not as hard as people make
	it out to seem, and I'm really enjoying it! I grew up speaking Spanish and English and I also took French all four years of high school.
	I chose <span class="emp">Georgia State</span> because it has a very diverse student population.<br>
	
	Thanks for visiting!! <img src = "bye.gif" alt = "bye!"></p>
